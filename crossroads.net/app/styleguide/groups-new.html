                        They help us discover who God is, who we are and what we were made to do. So we care a lot about Groups. From dude groups on a back porch, Bible studies in the home, family groups on playgrounds, business groups in a conference room or adventure groups out on a trail, God is just waiting to move in our lives <span style="font-style: italic;">wherever we are</span>.

You don’t have to be a spiritual guru, just interested in following God yourself and helping others do the same. If that’s you, apply today. (Don’t worry, it’s not nearly as intimidating as it sounds. We just want to get to know you and help you build a strong group.)
