        Relationships are critical to growth.

        They help us discover who God is, who we are and what we were made to do.
        So we care a lot about groups. This is the place to get informed, find a unique group where you can grow, apply and start one of your own.
        We also included some group resources so you can get the most out of your group.

        We need shepherds, disciplers, and people with vision.
        Connecting with others, building lasting relationships and getting vulnerable is a major part of spiritual growth.

                Where do Groups meet?
                Groups meet in homes, restaurants, and even the local coffee shop. Some Groups meet to run together and others may go for a hike. We can help you find a Group near you based on your passions and interests.

                How often do Groups meet?
                Groups meet throughout the week at different days and times. Some meet every week, some meet every other week, or some meet once a month.
                Use the Group Tool to check out whatâ€™s available.

                What can I expect from my Group?
                It depends on the Group you select. Some serve on the same team at church while other Groups study the Bible together. And some get together to enjoy a shared interest, such as kickball, motorcycles, or sewing. Find all the Group options here.

                What about my kids?
                Not all Groups offer childcare, but we offer up some options. Some Group participants split the cost of a sitter, share the responsibility of watching the kids, or make other arrangements. Learn more about childcare options by searching the below tool.
